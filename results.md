This page presents our results for the GBBS benchmark on a diverse set of
real-world graphs. Our focus is primarily on the Hyperlink2012 graph, which has
224 billion (symmetric) edges. This graph is currently (as of March, 2019) the
largest publicly available real-world graph.  We also include our results on the
Hyperlink2014 graph, which is roughly half the size of Hyperlink2012 and the
Clueweb graph, which is about one third the size of Hyperlink2012.
