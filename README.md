Repository that contains code for our SPAA submission "Theoretically Efficient
Parallel Graph Algorithms Can Be Fast and Scalable". The repository is currently
missing some utilities for converting between different formats (e.g. WebGraph
-> byte-pd) which we will add soon. We will also add descriptions of the I/O
specifications for our problems, and the parameters (e.g. the source for a
shortest path algorithm)) used to generate the results in the paper.
