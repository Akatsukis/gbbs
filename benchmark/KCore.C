// Usage:
// numactl -i all ./KCore -rounds 3 -s -m com-orkut.ungraph.txt_SJ
// flags:
//   required:
//     -s : indicates that the graph is symmetric
//   optional:
//     -m : indicate that the graph should be mmap'd
//     -c : indicate that the graph is compressed
//     -rounds : the number of times to run the algorithm
//     -fa : run the fetch-and-add implementation of k-core
//     -nb : the number of buckets to use in the bucketing implementation
