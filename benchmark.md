This page gives benchmark specifications for the problems considered
in our paper.

We include all relevant problem-specific details needed to reproduce
our results, e.g., the source used for single-source problems, as well
as the expected output for the problems on each of our input graphs.
Note that problems such as MIS/Maximal Matching have many valid
outputs.

The specifications can be accessed either using the navbar on the
left, or by clicking one of the links below:
