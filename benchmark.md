This section provides benchmark specifications for the problems considered
in our paper and gives details on how to compile and run the GBBS
implementations on our inputs.

The specification for each problem be found by clicking on the problem name in
the menu. Each benchmark consists of an input/output specification. Each problem
specification also provides details on how to compile and run our implementation
of the problem.

Where applicable we provide additional input details, such as
the source used for single-source problems and describe the expected output.

* [Download](/benchmarks/download/) provides links to obtain our benchmark
  implementations.
* [Requirements](/benchmarks/requirements/) lists the requirements for building
  our code.
* [Graph Formats](/benchmarks/formats/) describes the uncompressed and compressed
  adjacency graph input formats used by our implementations.
* [Graph Inputs](/benchmarks/inputs/) describes the graph inputs used in our
   experiments, and provides details on how to obtain them.
* [Definitions](/benchmarks/definitions/) gives definitions of the terms used by
  our benchmark specifications.
