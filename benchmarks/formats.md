We support the adjacency graph format used by the [Problem Based Benchmark
suite](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/benchmarks/graphIO.html)
and [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra).

The adjacency graph format starts with a sequence of offsets one for each
vertex, followed by a sequence of directed edges ordered by their source vertex.
The offset for a vertex i refers to the location of the start of a contiguous
block of out edges for vertex i in the sequence of edges. The block continues
until the offset of the next vertex, or the end if i is the last vertex. All
vertices and offsets are 0 based and represented in decimal. The specific format
is as follows:

```
AdjacencyGraph
<n>
<m>
<o0>
<o1>
...
<o(n-1)>
<e0>
<e1>
...
<e(m-1)>
```

This file is represented as plain text.

Weighted graphs are represented in the weighted adjacnecy graph format. The file
should start with the string "WeightedAdjacencyGraph". The m edges weights
should be stored after all of the edge targets in the .adj file.
